In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

How many orders were placed in January?
COUNT (ORDERID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(ORDERID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JANSALES 
WHERE PRODUCT="iPhone";

Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT ACCTNUM
FROM BIT_DB.CUSTOMERS CUST
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FEBSALES FEB
ON CUST.ORDER_ID=FEB.ORDERID;

Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT PRODUCT , PRICE
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY PRICE ASC LIMIT 1;

What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue,
product, quantity
from bit_db.febsales 
where location is "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
group by product;

How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
select 
count(distinct cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
